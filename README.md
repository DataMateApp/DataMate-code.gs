A Google Sheets add-on that transforms your spreadsheets into powerful data management tools.
Hi, I'm Dan Northway—Founder and Developer of DataMateApps. Before retiring, I spent my career as a Construction Project Manager and Superintendent. At most companies I worked with, spreadsheets were the backbone of project management. Everything—timecards, pay applications, logs—was stored in countless Excel and PDF files, requiring manual tracking.

I knew databases could streamline this process, but Excel was the standard. That’s when I had an idea: what if I could turn Excel itself into a lightweight database? Using forms and VBA, I built a system that stored, logged, and organized data efficiently—making sorting and filtering a breeze. It became an essential tool in my workflow.

After retiring, I revisited the concept, and a lightbulb went off. Why not make this work with any form? With help from the recently released ChatGPT, DataMate was born!

To clarify, DataMate isn’t a replacement for full-scale databases like SQL or enterprise-level solutions. It’s designed for small businesses and teams that already rely on spreadsheets but need a smarter, more structured way to manage their data. It bridges the gap between manual spreadsheets and more complex (often expensive) systems that may be overkill for smaller operations.

So why are DataMateApps free? Because the idea matters more than the programming. Technology has made development more accessible, and for me, this is both a passion project and a way to keep my mind sharp. More importantly, I see DataMate as a legacy—one that grows and evolves with every user.
