# DataMate Code for Google Sheets  
**Transform your spreadsheets into powerful data management tools.**  

## About DataMateApps  
Hi, I'm **Dan Northway**—Founder and Developer of DataMateApps. Before retiring, I spent my career as a **Construction Project Manager and Superintendent**.  

At most companies I worked with, spreadsheets were the backbone of project management. Everything—timecards, pay applications, logs—was stored in countless Excel and PDF files, requiring manual tracking.  

I knew databases could streamline this process, but Excel was the standard. That’s when I had an idea:  
> *What if I could turn Excel itself into a lightweight database?*  

Using **forms and VBA**, I built a system that stored, logged, and organized data efficiently—making sorting and filtering a breeze. It became an essential tool in my workflow.  

### The Birth of DataMate  
After retiring, I revisited the concept, and a lightbulb went off:  
> *Why not make this work with any form?*  

With help from the recently released **ChatGPT**, **DataMate was born!**  

DataMate isn’t a replacement for **full-scale databases like SQL** or enterprise-level solutions. Instead, it’s designed for **small businesses and teams** that rely on spreadsheets but need a **smarter, structured way to manage data**.  

It bridges the gap between **manual spreadsheets** and **complex (often expensive) systems** that may be overkill for smaller operations.  

### Why are DataMateApps Free?  
Because **the idea matters more than the programming.**  

Technology has made development more accessible, and for me, this is both a **passion project** and a way to **keep my mind sharp**. More importantly, I see DataMate as a **legacy—one that grows and evolves with every user.**
